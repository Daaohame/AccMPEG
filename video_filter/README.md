## How to use the filter program

In ```batch_filter_vid.py```,
1. update the paths of ```video_folder_path``` (where the original frames are) and ```results_folder_path``` (where the filtered frames should be).
2. add videos to be filtered in ```video_list```
3. update ```upper_bound_list```, ```lower_bound_list```, and ```confidence_threshold``` (if necessary)

Now you can run ```python batch_filter_vid.py``` to start.
